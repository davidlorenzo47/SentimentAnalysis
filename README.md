# SentimentAnalysis


The "Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews" project involved the development of advanced sentiment analysis models utilizing Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Roberta.

The project not only enhanced stakeholder engagement by a remarkable 30% through the creation of visually compelling dashboards but also facilitated the implementation of effective data-driven strategies.

To optimize efficiency, a streamlined process was implemented using pre-trained pipelines and VADER, resulting in a notable 50% reduction in analysis time.

Key technologies utilized in this successful endeavor include NLTK, Roberta, Matplotlib, SciPy, and NumPy.
